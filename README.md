# **Welcome to <strong>Black Corp: Integrated Cyberspace Intelligence Security</strong>**

Welcome to **<strong>Black Corp: Integrated Cyberspace Intelligence Security</strong>**, a student-founded initiative dedicated to developing cutting-edge intelligence solutions across cyberspace. We aim to equip professionals and enthusiasts with the tools, knowledge, and techniques to navigate the evolving world of intelligence, cybersecurity, and investigative analysis.

## **Who We Are**

We are a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) focused on developing and advancing the field of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) with a focus on cyberspace. Although still in its early stages, we are committed to learning, growing, and collaborating with like-minded individuals and organizations to fulfill our vision of becoming a leading name in OSINT and intelligence investigations.

**Our Organization operates in two divisions:**

1. **Public Division:** Focused on public awareness, tutorials, and developing open-source tools and resources for intelligence and cybersecurity professionals. This division is dedicated to education, outreach, and providing valuable resources to the global community.

2. **Deep-division:** Specializes in high-risk, covert, and intricate intelligence missions. The Deep-division operates beyond the surface level, tackling more sensitive, complex, and confidential operations within the cyberspace realm. This division is the backbone of our organization’s riskier missions and intelligence investigations, working on challenging objectives that often involve closed-source or restricted environments.
